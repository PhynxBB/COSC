# Packet Creation and Socket Programming

Socket Types
    Stream Sockets - Connection oriented and sequenced; methods for connection and teardown. Used with TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth
    Datagram Sockets - Connectionless; designed for quickly sending and receiving data. Used with UDP
    Raw Sockets - Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.

    User Space - Stream Sockets and Datagram Sockets (tcpdump, wireshark, netcat, /dev/tcp || /dev/udp)
    Kernel Space - Raw Sockets (hardware, tcpdump || wireshark to capture on the wire, nmap for OS id, netcat to create listener within WKPR)

Socket Creation and Privilege Level
    User Space Sockets - Most common and do not require elevated privileges.
    Kernel Space Sockets - Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user; requires elevated privileges.

Python Terminology
    Libraries
        Modules
            Functions
            Exceptions
            Constants
            Objects
            Types
    Network sockets use the Python3 Socket library and socket.socket function
        import socket
        s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)
