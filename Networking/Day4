Poor Man Chat Server
nc -lp 1337
nc ip 1337

NC Relays
    nc -lp 1234 0<pipe | nc -lp 1111 1>pipe
    Okay so basically how I interpret this issssss the following.
    This first section is using a named pipe to act as a buffer
    It is listening first for a file
    That file is then piped as the STDIN for a netcat listener in the second part
    Once you run a nc ip port command, itll take that STDIN

    nc 172.16.82.115 9876 0<pipe | nc 10.50.22.236 1111 1>pipe
    Reaching out to a listener, providing whatever is given as STDIN to the next client nc reaching out to a serve

for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
