Linux Processes

Startup Processes (SYSV)
    There are two primary processes after startup
        kernel-space [kthreadd]
        user-space /sbin/init
    All processes are forked from those two ^

Kernel vs User Space
    Kernel run in its own memory space
    User runs in a seperate memory space, only what they need. cant share

System Calls
    Interaction between a process and the kernel
    Two system calls !!!
        fork() the kernel creates a nearly identicaly copy of process
        exec() kernel starts a program, replacing the former
    shell -> fork() -> shell
                   `-> copy of shell -> exec(ls) -> ls
    ps -elf | awk '{print $4, $15}'
    ps -elf --forest --ppid 2
    ps -Nlf --pid 2
    btop

Process Ownership
    UID of ps
    RUID (Real user ID)
    EUID (Effective user ID)
    sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
