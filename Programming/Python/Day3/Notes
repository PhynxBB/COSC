fp = open("test.txt")
fp.close
r = read(default)
w = write

with open("test.txt") as fp:
    pass

with open('test.txt', 'w') as fp:
    fp.write('First Line \n')
    lines = ['Second Line\n', 'Third Line\n', 'Fourth line\n']
    fp.writelines(lines)

Really just lookup python file io
https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Files/ChapterAssessment.html
mess around with stuff like x = fp.read(???) and x = fp.readlines()
for line in fp

some key take aways from today are
- list.split()
- list = ''.join(list)
- list.append(element)
