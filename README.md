# COSC
If you're reading this, you're probably a COSC student trying to figure out the layout of this repo.
Class is broken into a couple of sections, with each major module having its on child directory.
I have tried my best to take consistent notes(denoted by Day1, Day2, etc)
I also upload some of the scripts we write utilizing the aformentioned notes. If you're looking for anything specific, ping me on Discord(Phynx#0342)
